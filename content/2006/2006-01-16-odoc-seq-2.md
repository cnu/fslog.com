seq &#8212; Prints a sequence of Nos to Stdout.

Summary :

**seq** prints the numbers from Start to End in steps. By default, Start and Step are 1, and by default each number is separated by a new line. All numbers can be reals, not just integers.

Examples :

> $ seq 6 &#8212; Print Nos from 1 to 6.
> 
> $ seq 2 6 &#8212; Print Nos from 2 to 6.
> 
> $ seq .1 .5 10 &#8212; Real numbers with factional step value 0.1.
> 
> $ seq 10 100 10000 &#8212; Print Nos from 10 to 10K with step value 100.
> 
> $ seq -w 10 100 10000 &#8212; All Nos are printed equal width.
> 
> $ seq -s&#8217; &#8216; 1 2 10 &#8212; Each number is separated by SPACE.
> 
> $ seq -f %1.f 1000000 1000001 &#8212; Print Nos with no exponent and no decimal point.
> 
> $ seq -f %e 1 5 &#8212; Print Nos with exponent and decimal point.

Note:

  1. Fractional increment may NOT end with END value.
  2. More formatting details are available in the info page.
