tac &#8212; Concatenate and Print files in reverse order.

Summary:

**tac** copies each file to standard output, reversing the records (lines by default) in each separately. It is doing the reverse function of the **CAT** command (**TAC**).

Example:

> $ tac myfile &#8212; Print the file (Line by Line) in reverse order.
> 
> $ tac -r -s &#8216;[^a-zA-z0-9-]&#8217; myfile &#8212; Print the file (Word by Word) in reverse order, by passing the Regular expression.
> 
> $ tac -r -s &#8216;.|&#8217; myfile &#8212; Print the file (Char by Char) in reverse order.
