Atlast I convinced my father to allow me to use his credit card to register a domain. I have atlast registered a domain name (http://www.fslog.com) with [Yahoo][1]. The domain is still pending and would be active later. I guess by 2 days I would have setup my nameservers and changed the hosting information with [Zeeblo][2].
  
So fslog.com will become this blog&#8217;s new home.
  
**Update:** I have changed the domain name and the new and final home of this blog is <http://www.fslog.com>. Got a few problems in the start, but with a little help from **[tinster][3]** at **#wordpress** sorted it out.
