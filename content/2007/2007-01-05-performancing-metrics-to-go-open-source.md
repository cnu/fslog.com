It also has various other services for bloggers like [Metrics][2] for tracking the visitors of your blog. It also an advertising network called Performancing Partners. Even I use these services and you too can advertise on this blog by clicking on the ad in the sidebar.

There is another good news for the FOSS community as Performancing will be releasing the code for [Metrics as Open Source][3]. It is great to see that we get such quality software and hope many developers continue to enhance it.
