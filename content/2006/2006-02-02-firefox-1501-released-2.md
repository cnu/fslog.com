[Firefox 1.5.0.1][1] was released and it offers many stability and security updates.

Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in Firefox 1.5.0.1:

  * Improved stability.
  * Improved support for Mac OS X.
  * International Domain Name support for Iceland (.is) is now enabled.
  * Fixes for several memory leaks.
  * Several security enhancements.

Due to the automatic update feature in 1.5, I just had to use the **Check for updates feature** in the Help menu. Beware not all your extensions may not work in the new update.
