[Mandriva One][1] is a new Live CD that has all the tools required for Office work, Internet, Multimedia, etc. You just have to insert the Mandriva One CD and boot through it. You can also easily install the distro onto your harddisk using a few clicks. It also copies all the files that were created during your live session. Though I am not a fan of Mandriva series, it is the best distro that a newbie can use.
