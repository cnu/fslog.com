Today is the release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS(Long Term Support). There are seperate editions for Desktop, Server, fast and easy install. You will be supported by security updates for 5 years on the server and 3 years for the desktop.

There are various [features in the new version][1].

**Desktop**

  * fast and easy graphical installer
  * faster system startup and login
  * simplified menu organisation
  * graphical shutdown process
  * GNOME 2.14.1, OpenOffice.org 2.0.2, X.org 7.0

<span style="font-weight: bold">Server</span>

  * New kernels targeted at server platforms. The server kernels are tuned differently than the desktop kernels (providing better performance for server applications).
  * There are both low-end, and &#8220;big iron&#8221; server kernels. The low-end server kernel is generic, and should work on the same equipment that the desktop kernel runs on. The highend server kernel is geared towards systems with greater than 8 CPUs (ES7000 / Summit / BIGSMP).
  * Turn-key LAMP installation for this common deployment scenario &#8211; have your LAMP server setup automatically
