[Rails Day 2006][1] is an event for all Rails enthusiasts to write some nice application using Ruby on Rails. The only catch is that you must do all this in 24 hours. You can have upto 3 members in a team and there are lots of prizes to be won. Just visit the site for the [rules][2]. By the way, the contest is on 17th of June. Is there time for me to learn Ruby(from scratch) and also learn Rails and participate in this contest? Is Ruby so easy that one can learn it withing 10 days and also create a great app with it (and hope to get a prize?).
  
I was thinking of learning Ruby this holiday and I think its the time to start. 

Update: I have updated the site&#8217;s theme just to show that I have started learning Ruby.
