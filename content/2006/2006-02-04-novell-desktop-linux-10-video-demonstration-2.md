Check out these [video demonstrations of Novell Desktop Linux 10][1]. Transparent Video, being dragged around the screen, while playing, and the window &#8220;Wobbles&#8221; while you drag it. Also switching virtual desktops looks cool (does a 3D cube affect). Looks like Alt-Tab switching is cool, and looks like it has &#8220;expose&#8221; type affects like Mac OS X.
