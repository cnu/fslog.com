Sorry for not posting for a long time. I have been living without my computer for about 2 weeks and I am afraid that I may become mad. I will most probably get my new computer by May 1 or 2. I think I will have an AMD Athlon 3000+ 64bit, 1 Gig of RAM, 120GB harddisk and so on. I wonder what to do till I get my computer.

And by the way, did I mention that tomorrow is my 20th birthday.
