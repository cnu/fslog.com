According to [TheRegister][1], Microsoft has won its claim over the patent rights over its File Allocation Table(FAT) which was the default filesystem used on Windows. This could mean that Microsoft could go after FLOSS developers by forcing them to pay a royalty for using FAT. The US Patent and Trademark Office ruled that the file system is &#8220;novel and non-obvious&#8221; and, therefore, deserving of a patent. Do you really think so?
