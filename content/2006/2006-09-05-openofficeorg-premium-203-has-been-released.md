Though it is an excellent office suite, the absence of bundled pictures, fonts made many to no switch over from Microsoft Office. Here is [Openoffice.org Premium][2] which has these tools along with it.

It has new features like

  * Clip Art (currently more than 2,800 objects)
  * Templates (number varies by language)
  * Samples (number varies by language)
  * Documentation (if available)
  * Fonts (more than 90 fonts)

You can download it from here:
