Here is a quick review of what happened all the days that I weren&#8217;t here.

  * Ubuntu [Edgy Eft][1] [6.10 released][2] on October 26. This release wasn&#8217;t so satisfying as there were numerous problems with upgrading and still there is no proper flash support for 64bit. I am planning to reinstall Edgy 386 instead of the 64bit version.
  * Novell made an agreement with Microsoft to boost the interoperability of their competing software products on Nov 2.
  * Later Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft said that [Linux uses Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual property][3]. Microsoft will pay Novell $440 million in coupons for a year worth of maintenance. Novell will have to pay $40 million for using the IP of Microsoft. For this money all Novell users can say that they paid properly for the intellectual property.
  * But Novell says that this agreement has nothing to do with any infringement.
