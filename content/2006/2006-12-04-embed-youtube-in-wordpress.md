When I tried to post the previous post I tried hard at embedding the Youtube code into this. The Visual MCE editor didn&#8217;t accept the code and I couldn&#8217;t embed the video. So, I changed my settings to use the old plain editor instead of the WYSIWYG editor. It is there is the Users > Your Profile. Under the Personal Options, uncheck the &#8220;Use the visual rich editor when writing&#8221; option and Update your profile. Now you can easily embed the videos.
