tar &#8212; Create/Add/Extract **T**ape **AR**chives files.

Summary:

tar is an archiving program designed to store and extract files from an archive file known as a tar file. A tar file may be made on a tape drive, however, it is also common to write a tar file to a normal file.

Normally &#8220;.tar&#8221; file is not a compressed file. It is actually a collection of files within a single file.
  
&#8220;.tar.gz&#8221;/ &#8220;.tgz&#8221; is a collection of files which are compressed. You can also use BZip2 compresion for the tar files.
