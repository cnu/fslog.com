route &#8212; Show / Manipulate the IP routing table.

Summary:

Route manipulates the kernel&#8217;s IP routing tables. Its primary use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via a network interface (like eth0 &#8230;).

Example:

> $ route &#8212; Show routing table. It will try resolve the name for IP.
> 
> $ route -n &#8212; Same as above. But won&#8217;t resolve.
> 
> $ route -ee &#8212; Show more detailed info.
> 
> $ route -A inet6 &#8212; Show IPv6 related route info.
> 
> \# route add -net 127.0.0.0 &#8212; Adds the normal loopback entry.
> 
> \# route add -net 192.168.14.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 &#8212; Adds a route to the network 192.168.14.x via &#8220;eth0&#8221;.
> 
> \# route add default gw midas-gw dev eth1 &#8212; Set the default Gateway for eth1.
> 
> \# route del default dev eth0 &#8212; Remove the default Gateway of eth0.
> 
> \# route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject &#8212; Sets rejecting route for the &#8220;10.x.x.x.&#8221;
> 
> \# route add -net 192.168.13.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw wify1 &#8212; Adds the net &#8220;192.168.13.x&#8221; to be gatewayed through wify1.
