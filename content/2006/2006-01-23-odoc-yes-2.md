yes &#8212; Print a string until interrupted

Summary :

It prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces & followed by a newline, forever until it is killed. &#8216;yes&#8217; can be used to feeds a continuous string of the character to another process and create dummy process for learning the process control.

Example:

> $ yes &#8212; Prints \`y&#8217; followed by a newline until killed.
> 
> $ yes foobar &#8212; Prints **foobar** followed by a newline until killed.
> 
> $ yes \`cat myfile\` &#8212; Print myfile content until killed.
> 
> $ yes | fsck /dev/hda1 &#8212; Runs fsck non-interactively.
> 
> $ yes | rm -r mydir &#8212; Same effect as rm -rf mydir.
> 
> $ yes > /dev/null & &#8212; Dummy process. Redirects &#8216;y&#8217; to null process and also runs in the background.
