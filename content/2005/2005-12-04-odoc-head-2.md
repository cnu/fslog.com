head &#8211; Output the 1st part of files.

Summary :

I should have posted this after the [tail][1] command, but forgot to do so. It does exactly the opposite by printing the first 10 lines of each FILE to stdout. With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read stdin.

Examples :

> $ head &#8212; Read 10 lines from stdin & dump to stdout
> 
> $ head foo &#8212; Show 1st 10 lines of the file.
> 
> $ head f1 f2 &#8212; Show 1st 10 lines of file f1 & f2 with header.
> 
> $ head -q f1 f2 &#8212; same as above But with-out header.
> 
> $ head -n 5 myfile &#8212; Show 1st 5 lines only.
> 
> $ head -c 15 myfile &#8212; Show 1st 15Bytes only.
> 
> $ head -c 15k myfile &#8212; Show 1st 15KB only.
