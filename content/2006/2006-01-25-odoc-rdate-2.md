rdate &#8212; Get the time from Remote machine.

Summary :

It connects to an Remote Time Server over a TCP/IP network, printing the returned time and/or setting the system clock. The time in remote server is maintained properly. So that all machines can get the time from that server.

Example:

> $ rdate -p 192.168.1.5 &#8212; Print the time returned by the remote machine.
> 
> $ rdate -s remote.pc.com &#8212; Set the system time to the time returned by the remote machine (Need Root permission).
  
> $ rdate -u myserver &#8212; Use UDP instead of TCP as the transport.
> 
> $ rdate -l myserver &#8212; Use syslog to log errors and output (Useful when it is used in cron jobs).

NOTE:

  * Remote server should run the time service in port 37.
  * Firewall should not block port 37.
