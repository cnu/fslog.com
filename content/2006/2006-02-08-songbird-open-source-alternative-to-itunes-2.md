Instead of connecting to one locked store full of DRMmed goods, it can connect to any and all available music (and video) on the internet.

It is built on the same platform as that of Firefox and it acts as a specialised browser for music. Looks like a nicer solution getting good songs.

Currently the site is overloaded so here are the download [mirror1][3] and [mirror2][4].
