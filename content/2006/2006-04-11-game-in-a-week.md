Found this news in Reddit where Jay Barnson has created a simple Role Playing Game(RPG) within a week(40 hours). He didn&#8217;t have any big budget or great tools. He used only freely available tools with basic APIs to create the game. His toolset is:

**Code:**

  * [Python 2.3][1] 
  * PythonWin
  * [PyGame][2]
  * [Py2EXE to compile this into an executable for distribution][3]

**Art:**

  * [Gimp 2.0][4] 
  * MS Paint (which comes with Windows) &#8211; for pasting up screen shots grabbed by hitting the PrintScreen key (GiMP doesn&#8217;t like these for some reason)
  * Free textures available from places like [Toob&#8217;s Tiled Textures][5] and [Mayang&#8217;s Free Textures][6]

**Sound:**

  * [Audacity][7] plus a microphone or free sound samples.

This looks like a nice project to be done. I am downloading the game to try it out.
