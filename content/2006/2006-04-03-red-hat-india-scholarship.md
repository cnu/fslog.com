[Red Hat India][1] is having a [scholarship program][2], conducted jointly with [eKALAVYA][3] program of Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology, IIT Bombay. The first prize for this would be Rs.2 Lakhs &#8211; approximately 4400 USD. The problem now is that I need some ideas to propose for this program.
