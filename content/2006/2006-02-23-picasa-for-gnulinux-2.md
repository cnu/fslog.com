Found this news via [NewLinuxUser][1] and it is nice to see that Google is thinking of porting [Picasa][2] the famous image editing program for GNU/Linux users. [Google is working along with CodeWeavers to produce a GNU/Linux version of Picasa][3] and CodeWeavers are responsible for the Cross over office application. It is nice to see one of my favourite apps in windows to be ported to Linux.
