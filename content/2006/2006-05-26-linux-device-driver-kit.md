Are you a device driver developer who longs for a proper device driver development kit for Linux? Here is a [Linux Device Driver Kit][1] which is released as a CD image for download. This CD image consists of everything a device driver author would wish for &#8211; copy of linux kernel source code, pre-built copies of all of the in-kernel docbook documentation for easy browsing, a full copy of the O&#8217;Reilly book, &#8220;Linux Device Drivers, third edition&#8221;.

There are also few things that would be included in the future releases, like

  * searchable index of all documentation
  * prettier webpages
  * more documentation
  * possible inclusion of the [KernelNewbies][2] wiki.

There is also a CDROM label included in the root directory which could be printed.
