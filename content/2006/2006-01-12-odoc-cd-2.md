cd &#8212; Change the Current Directory

Summary :

If there is one command that I use frequently it is **cd**. cd is bash shell&#8217;s built-in command. It is used to change the present working Dir to specific Dir.

Examples :

> $ cd &#8212; Change the current Dir to $HOME ($HOME is the default).
> 
> $ cd ~ &#8212; Same as above.
> 
> $ cd ~foo &#8212; Goto the Home Dir of foo

> $ cd projects &#8212; Change the current Dir to projects
> 
> $ cd .. &#8212; Goto the parent Dir.
> 
> $ cd &#8211; &#8212; Goto the last visited Dir.

Tip:

CDPATH &#8211; Easy access to frequently used Dirs. For example, I use /usr/a/dir1, /usr/b/dir2/ and /usr/c/dir3 very frequently. So I added the above dirs CDPATH like this

`CDPATH=/usr/a/dir1/:/usr/b/dir2/:/usr/c/dir3/`

<div style="text-align: left">
  Now there no need for me to type exact path to cd. Just cd dir1 will cd to /usr/a/dir1. Actually cd will looks into CDPATH before doing the action.Note:</p> 
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Before changing to new path, cd will save the old path in the $OLDPWD evn variable.
    </li>
    <li>
      After changing to new path, cd will save the new path in the $PWD env variable.
    </li>
  </ol>
