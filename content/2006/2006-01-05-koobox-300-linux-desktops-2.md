<img width="128" height="58" align="left" id="image100" alt="Koobox" src="/uploads/2006/01/koobox_logo..jpg" /><tag>Koobox</tag> is a sub $300 <tag>GNU/Linux</tag> desktop released by <tag>[Mirus][1]</tag> which runs on <tag>Linspire</tag> GNU/Linux. Though <tag>[Ubuntu][2][</tag> has an <tag>OEM installation][2]</tag>, I still haven&#8217;t used Linspire GNU/Linux.

There are three models that are available with Koobox.

  1. Essential: $299
  2. Multimedia: $399
  3. Performance: $499

Currently it is available only in US and I wonder when it will be available in India. And how much successfull it could be here.
