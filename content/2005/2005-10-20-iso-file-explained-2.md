An ISO file is the most popular format through which almost all GNU/Linux distributions are offered. By offering a single ISO file, the users can easily download the entire contents of the CD and burn it.
  
You have to burn the ISO properly and not as a single file. Your burning software will probably have some kind of facility to burn a CD image.
