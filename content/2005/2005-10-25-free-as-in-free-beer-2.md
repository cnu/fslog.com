After reading the article I wrote earlier where [opensource powers a milking robot][1], I saw another link where someone has [brewed beer from milk][2].
  
There is also another link where they have posted a recipe for brewing beer under the [Creative Commons License][3] and so you can create your own [open-source beer][4].
  
Who said &#8220;free as in free beer&#8221; is not possible.

Can someone try the recipe and tell whether it tastes the same as the original one?
