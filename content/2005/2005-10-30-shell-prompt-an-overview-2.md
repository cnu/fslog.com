Now I have decided to write articles which will help the new linux user to do things the pro-way i.e. using the shell.
  
There are many different shells available with the GNU/Linux system.
  
Sh &#8211; The old UNIX shell
  
Bash &#8211; Bourne Again Shell &#8211; rewrite of the sh shell
  
csh &#8211; C Shell &#8211; similar to C funtions
  
and so on.

Most GNU/Linux systems come with the default Bash shell and it can be recognised by a **$** prompt or a # prompt.
  
The $ prompt indicates that you are logged in as an ordinary user.
  
The # prompt indicates that you are logged in as a root user. This is most powerful user, so just be careful with it.
  
You can log in to the root user at anytime by using the **su** command.
  
I think this gives a basic overview of the shell. I have decided to start writing a series which will teach a new command everyday.
