Of late I have been using [SciTE][1], a lightweight text editor available for both Windows and Linux. It is based on [Scintilla][2] &#8211; _a free source code editing component for Win32 and GTK+_. It features syntax highlighting for many popular languages and also automatic indenting of source code. Also you can export the source code into many formats like:

  * HTML
  * RTF
  * PDF
  * LaTeX
  * XML
