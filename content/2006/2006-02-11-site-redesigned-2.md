Free Software Blog now has a new look. Nearly a month after me [changing hosts][1], I have atlast redesigned the theme with my favourite color &#8211; blue. This was done with [Shocking Blue Green][2] theme as a base. I am still yet finished with this theme and may bring in more smaller changes. Please comment on the theme and also suggest what other things can be made. Also if you can&#8217;t view this page correctly in any browser, please inform me via comments.
