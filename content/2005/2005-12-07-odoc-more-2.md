more &#8212; File perusal filter for crt viewing

Summary :

Perusal means the act of reading, especially of reading through or with care. More is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.

Examples :

> $ more myfile1 myfile2 &#8212; Show myfile 1 & 2 page by page.
> 
> $ more -10 myfile &#8212; Show 10lines/page.
> 
> $ more -d myfile &#8212; Usually more show % of viewed content only at the bottom. With -d it shows more verbose prompt.
> 
> $ more -p -10 myfile &#8212; Don&#8217;t scroll the output. Just the screen and display the text.
> 
> $ more -c -10 myfile &#8212; Don&#8217;t scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
> 
> $ more -s myfile &#8212; Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.
> 
> $ more +/foo myfile &#8212; The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before each file is displayed.
> 
> $ more +10 myfile &#8212; Start at line number 10.

Apart from this option, more will support few interactive commands also. For example

> :f &#8212; Show current filename
> 
> :n &#8212; Next file
> 
> :p &#8212; Previous file
> 
> b &#8212; Move backward
> 
> f &#8212; Move forward
> 
> Space &#8212; Next page
> 
> ENTER &#8212; Next Line
