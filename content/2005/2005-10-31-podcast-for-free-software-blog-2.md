Free Software blog now has a podcast.
  
I have used the [Talkr][1] website to publish my RSS feeds as podcasts as well. You can listen to the podcasts by clicking on the link &#8220;Listen to this article&#8221; after every post. Or you can subscribe to the podcast by using a software. It automatically downloads the podcasts and plays them for you.
  
I would suggest [iPodder][2] for managing your podcasts as it is a free software and is available for Windows 2000/XP, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux.
