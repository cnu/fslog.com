[GoboLinux][1] is a Linux distribution that breaks with the historical Unix directory hierarchy. Basically, this means that there are no directories such as /usr and /etc. The main idea of the alternative hierarchy is to store all files belonging to an application in its own separate subtree; therefore we have directories such as /Programs/GCC/2.95.3/lib.
  
The FAQ clearly states that this is not a distro for a newbie. This is more for the user who would like to compile his own software. Here is a [nice article about GoboLinux at linux.com][2] and here are [some screenshots][3].
