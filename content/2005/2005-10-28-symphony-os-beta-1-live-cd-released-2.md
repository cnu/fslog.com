The new Symphony OS Beta 1 Live CD was released and it sure looks promising. Now about the Symphony OS.
  
From the website <http://www.symphonyos.com>

> Symphony OS is a Desktop computer operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and Knoppix GNU/Linux. Rather than using the KDE or Gnome Desktop environments as most Linux distributions do, the Symphony OS team has created the revolutionary Mezzo Desktop environment. Symphony provides what we consider to be the easiest to use Linux experience there is.
> 
> The Symphony OS Project is an Open Source project, not controlled by any business entity, operated by Ryan Quinn and Jason Spisak. In the future we hope to form a non-profit Symphony OS Foundation to further our development goals.
