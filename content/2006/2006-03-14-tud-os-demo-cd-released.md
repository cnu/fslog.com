The OS Group of Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden ([TUD:OS][1]) has released a live demo CD of their operating system project. They have been researching on microkerne-based design with focus on real-time and security.

Some highlights of the Demo CD are:

  * A new approach for securing graphical user interfaces called Nitpicker,
  * Multiple virtualized Linux kernels running deprivileged on the L4/Fiasco microkernel,
  * A survey of device driver architectures on microkernel-based systems,
  * The presentation of our virtual-file-system approach,
  * A secure transaction application, Qt3 demo applications, and libSDL-based applications running directly on our custom operating system foundation.

More information &#8211; an ISO image, and screenshots are available at the [demo CD website][1]
