[OpenBSD][1] 3.8 was released November 1, 2005. This is the 18th release via CD (and 19th via FTP).
  
Though I haven&#8217;t tried OpenBSD, I have heard really good reviews of it. It is having a great record for 8 years with only a single remote hole in the default installation. Here are the [mirrors where you can download OpenBSD][2].
  
Anybody have tried OpenBSD, please put in your valuable comments here.
