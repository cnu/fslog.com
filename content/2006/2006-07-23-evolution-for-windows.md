It provides integrated mail, contact management and calendaring. You can download the [windows installer for Evolution][2] and it is a big 50meg download. Evolution is an MS Exchange client and should work with Exchange servers. Though I find no use for an email client as of now, I would try it later &#8211; when I get my ADSL connection.
