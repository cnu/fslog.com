I have installed a poll plugin for this blog and have started a new poll. The question is

<p align="center">
  &#8220;<strong>Which GNU/Linux distro you use</strong>&#8220;
</p>

<p align="left">
  I have added the following choices
</p>

  * Red Hat Linux
  * SuSe Linux
  * Mandriva
  * Debian GNU/Linux
  * Ubuntu GNU/Linux
  * I don&#8217;t use Linux

  If your favourite distro is missing, please comment under this post. Also try to tell what are the best features that you find here. If anyone wants me to remove the poll (cause it is a lame question), feel free to comment.

  <strong>Update</strong>: Added Gentoo as one of the choices.
