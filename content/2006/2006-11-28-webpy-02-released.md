<img align="right" id="image295" alt="webpy Logo" src="/uploads/2006/11/webpylogo.png" />[web.py][1] is a web framework for python that is so simple and powerful. The new version [0.2][2] was released on 27 Nov after many days lying in the subversion repository. The website also presents a new layout.

It is a nice framework and I have also tried writing a very simple web app using it. I think I would mostly be using this framework for my final year project. Or are there any other better frameworks available?
