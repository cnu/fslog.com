[MINIX 3][1] is a new open-source operating system designed to be highly reliable and secure. It is based somewhat on previous versions of MINIX, but is fundamentally different in many key ways. MINIX 1 and 2 were intended as teaching tools; MINIX 3 adds the new goal of being usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability.

MINIX 3 is initially targeted at the following areas:

  * Applications where very high reliability is required
  * Single-chip, small-RAM, low-power, $100 laptop for Third-World children
  * Embedded systems (e.g., cameras, DVD recorders, cell phones)
  * Applications where the GPL is too restrictive (MINIX 3 uses a BSD-type license)
  * Education (e.g., operating systems courses at universities)

MINIX 3 Features

  * POSIX compliant
  * Networking with TCP/IP
  * Two ANSI C compilers (ACK and gcc)
  * Over 300 UNIX programs
  * Many improvements since V2
  * Full multiuser and multiprogramming
  * Support for memory up to 4 GB
  * Device drivers run as user processes
  * Full C source code supplied
  * Runs on 386, 486, Pentium, etc.
