It has been a long time since I blogged in FSLog as my blog host was down for several weeks. I have found [another host][1] which provides free services for this blog. I tried to change to the free [wordpress.com][2] host but was not satisfied due to the limitations (no plugins, themes, etc). Also I wouldn&#8217;t like to lose this PR4 site. So I am back here and I will renew this domain in 1 month. I should promise myself to blog more and also bring in newer services.
