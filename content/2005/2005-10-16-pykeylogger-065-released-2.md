[PyKeylogger][1] is a simple keylogger written in python. It is primarily designed for personal backup purposes, rather than stealth keylogging (though it can do that, too). It does not raise any trust issues, since it is a short python script that you can easily examine.

This is a bugfix release. Fixed the first-ever reported bug (1323518), logging to onefile.
