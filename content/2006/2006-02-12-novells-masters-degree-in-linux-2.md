Novell has teamed up with Charles Sturt University in Australia to offer what we believe is the first [Masters Degree focused on Linux][1]. The university decided to debut the degree because of rapid growth in demand for Linux training and expertise. The degree program includes obtaining Novell&#8217;s Certified Linux Engineer certification, including passing of the Novell Practicum exam. This is good evidence of growing interest in Linux by new entrants into the IT workforce, and the University&#8217;s choice to go with Novell in the curriculum is a nice vote of confidence.
