There was a heavy downpour in Chennai and it rained about 24 cm within 4 hours. So almost the entire city was switched off from power by the electricity board as a precautionary measure.
  
Power returned back to my area after more than 30 hours. Due to the rain I was not able to go for the premiere of &#8220;Legend of Zorro&#8221;. Very bad day.
  
Anyway I am back with more blogging and more news and articles.
