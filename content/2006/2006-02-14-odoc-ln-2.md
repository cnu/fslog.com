ln &#8212; Make LiNks between files.

Summary :

Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK\_NAME. If LINK\_NAME is omitted, a link with the same basename as the TARGET is created in the current directory. By default, it makes HardLinks.

A &#8220;hard link&#8221; is another name for an existing file. The link and the original are indistinguishable. They share the same inode.

A Soft links/Symbolic links/symlinks are a special file type. The link file actually refers to a different file, by name. At runtime kernel automatically &#8220;dereferences&#8221; the link and operates on the target of
  
the link.

Example:

> $ ln &#8211;help &#8212; Show help info.
> 
> $ ln A B &#8212; Creates hard link B for file A.
> 
> $ ln -b A B &#8212; Same as above. If B is already exist then Take a backup (B~) and creates new B.
> 
> $ ln -b -S .bak A B &#8212; Same as above. If B is already exist then Take a backup with specified extension name(B.bak) & creates new B.
> 
> $ ln -f A B &#8212; Force. If B is exist then overwrite it.
> 
> $ ln -i A B &#8212; Interactive. Prompt the user for removing the already existing file B.
> 
> $ ln -s A B &#8212; Creates soft link B for file A.
> 
> $ ln -s dir1/myfile &#8212; Creates link ./myfile pointing to dir1/myfile.
> 
> $ ln -s dir1/myfile myfile &#8212; Creates link ./myfile pointing to dir1/myfile.
> 
> $ ln -s a b .. &#8212; Creates links ../a and ../b pointing to ./a & ./b
