find &#8212; Search for files in a directory hierarchy

Summary:

Find is useful to search in the deeply nested collection folder. It can execute some actions on the files, which are found by it and it provides lots of useful options for file searching.

Example:

> $ find &#8212; List all files in current and its sub Dir.
> 
> $ find / -name resolv.conf &#8212; Find the resolv.conf
> 
> $ find /etc -name &#8216;\*conf\*&#8217; &#8212; Find all conf file /etc Dir.
> 
> $ find ~/ -size 1000c &#8212; Find files that have a size equal to 1KB.
> 
> $ find ~/ -size +1500c &#8212; Find files that have a size > 1KB.
> 
> $ find ~/ -size -1500c &#8212; Find files that have a size < 1KB. $ find ~/ -empty -- Find empty files and directories. $ find ~/ -amin -5 -- Find files accessed in last 5 minutes. $ find ~/ -atime -1 -- Find files accessed in last 24 hours. $ find ~/ -mmin -5 -- Find files modified in last 5 minutes. $ find ~/ -mtime -2 -- Find files modified in last 48 hours. $ find ~/ -size +1kc -and -mtime 2 -- Find files (Size >1K & modified time is 2 Days)
> 
> $ find ~/ -nouser &#8212; Find files owned by an invalid user.
> 
> $ find ~/ -user user1 &#8212; Find files owned by user1.
> 
> $ find ~/ -maxdepth 2 -name &#8216;fi*&#8217; &#8212; Search for files starting with &#8216;fi&#8217; and don&#8217;t go more 2 level down in the Dir structure.
> 
> $ find ~/ -name &#8216;*.conf&#8217; -ls &#8212; Find the all .conf files and print the output in ls -l format.
> 
> $ find ~/ -name &#8216;*.txt&#8217; -exec cat {} ; &#8212; Find all text files and cat the files.
> 
> $ find ~/ -name &#8216;*.txt&#8217; -printf %hn &#8212; Find all text file and print the path of the each file.

NOTE:

  * In the examples, I used Home path for searching the file. You can change it to any other path.
  * Read the man page, to know about other useful and advance options.
