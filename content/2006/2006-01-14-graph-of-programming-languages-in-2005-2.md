Saw this nice site which displays a [graph of the programming languages][1] that were most sought after. [Indeed][2] is a site where one can search for any job listed.

The popularity of Python has been rising (though it fell in december) and so is ruby (steady rise). I still haven&#8217;t tried my hand at Ruby, though I got a book. I think I should see how it is. Also Lisp was in my agenda for a long time, but never had any time to do that.

So, what languages do you think are hot right now?
