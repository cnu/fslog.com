MusikCube is based on an embedded SQL database engine called SQLite. It is a very fast database engine which makes creating Dynamic Playlist easy.

It has an interesting feature where it automatically randomizes the playlist based on your listening habits. The more you listen, the more it becomes smarter.

It also makes transferring audio files to your removable devices. It can automatically detect your MP3 player and can transfer the files to it. Though the interface isn&#8217;t like iTunes or Winamp, it looks like a decent player.

But there is only a windows version of it and it can be [downloaded][2] from the sourceforge site.
