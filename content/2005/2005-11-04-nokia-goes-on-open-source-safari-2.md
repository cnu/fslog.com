Nokia, the mobile phone giant has created an open-source browser based on Safari for smartphones. This team of Nokia and Safari will deliver a web browser for the [S60 smartphone sotware platform][2].
  
Nokia says the browser, which will be made available to other companies licensing the S60 platform for their own smartphones, will give users a better surfing experience. It is designed to display Web pages on a phone exactly as they look on a monitor.
  
The browser includes pop-up blocking, access to RSS feeds and a text search feature. It uses components from Apple&#8217;s Safari Web Kit
