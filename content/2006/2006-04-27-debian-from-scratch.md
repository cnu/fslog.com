Most of you must have heard about [Linux from Scratch][1] &#8211; a project project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code. Here is a similar kind of project, by John Goerzen, the [Debian From Scratch][2].

DFS is really two systems:

  1. a bootable CD for repairing Linux systems or installing Debian
  2. the program that generates the CDs that are used for #1

You can also download the [ISO images from the DFS site][3].
