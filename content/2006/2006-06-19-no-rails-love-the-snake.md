I told previously that I would spend the holidays learning Ruby and Rails, for [Rails Day 2006][1]. But, unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t learn much to build a really nice app in Rails. And Rails Day 2006 has finally [ended][2]. I think the prime reason for my failure was that it was difficult for me to get to learn Ruby. I have been a python guy and love the whitespace and clear syntax it provides. I mean, why should there be two ways to run a simple loop or a if condition.
  
Also I see no use for [blocks][3]. It just makes reading someone&#8217;s code more difficult. But thats not the case with python. The code is easier to understand. Infact I could easily learn the language less than a week(even less).
  
So, here I am trying to stay with Python and try my hand at some of the web frameworks.
