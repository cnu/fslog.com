First a very Happy New Year to all. I must first apologize for not posting regularly. But yesterday I went for a [reunion][1] among my old school friends and we had a great party. I think this year onwards I must try to post regularly and also try to write nice articles. I am planning to shift my blog from [Blogger][2] to a [WordPress][3] one. I must get some money first and try to get some space. If you feel like donating to it, please mail me at [srinivasanr@gmail.com][4].
  
And Happy New Year again.
