[Easy Ubuntu][1] is an easy way to make Ubuntu usable in few minutes. This is a beginner&#8217;s tool using a graphical interface.

Easy Ubuntu allows you to:

  * Add extra repositories for installing a lot of additional software.
  * Install multimedia codecs for reading all videos, musics and DVDs.
  * Activate the &#8220;audio preview&#8221; feature in Nautilus.
  * Install the most needed Firefox plugins: Flash, Java, Real, videos. Adds Microsoft fonts, GNOME&#8217;s Firefox buttons, officials Firefox icons.
  * Install archiving support for RAR and ACE.
  * Install the most used peer-to-peer softwares: aMule (a clone of eMule) and Azureus (for Bittorent).
  * Install the Skype voice-over-IP software. (Warning: at this time Skype is **not** packaged for Breezy so install don&#8217;t work)
  * MSN: Install AMSN cvs with webcam support.
  * Num lock: Active the num lock at system startup.
  * Replace the GNOME foot logo with Ubuntu&#8217;s logo.
  * Install the NVIDIA or ATI driver for 3D support.

I guess everyone using Ubuntu must get this and install. Really how easy life has become with free sotwares.
