I got mail about a nice website called **[in pictures][1]** from Chris Charuhas. It is a nice site having tutorials about using Office, OpenOffice.org, Dreamweaver, etc.

The interesting part of this is that it is fully based on pictures. All the tutorials have nice explanations with screenshots explaining how to do every step. They are easy to understand and I would like to see more such tutorials for other open source softwares. Their press release says that they would bring in more tutorials for programming languages like PHP, Perl, etc. I would also like to see tutorials for other applications like Gimp, Evolution, etc., for the normal user.

Maybe this mode of teaching will help bring in more people to FOSS world.
