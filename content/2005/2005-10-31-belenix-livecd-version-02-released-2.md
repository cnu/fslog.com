Developed at the India Engineering Centre of Sun Microsystems in Bangalore, BeleniX is trying to popularise OpenSolaris in the growing open source user and developer community in India and abroad.&#8221; OSDir [provides the screenshots][2].

But I wonder why they have named it as Belenix. The name suggests that it is some sort of a GNU/Linux distribution. Anyway what other name can they have chosen? Any suggestions?
