cat &#8212; CATenate files & print on the STDOUT

Summary:

From Jargon File: Catenate is an obscure word meaning &#8220;to connect in a series&#8221;, which is what the &#8220;cat&#8221; command does to one or more files.

Cat will conCATenate the FILE(s) / STDIN to STDOUT.

Examples:

> $ cat foo &#8212; Dump the file named foo to STDOUT (please be careful with the case of the filename)
> 
> $ cat File1 File2 File3 &#8212; Dump File1, File2 & File3
> 
> $ cat -b File &#8212; Print the File with Number for Non blank lines
> 
> $ cat -s File &#8212; Squeeze multiple blank lines to single.
> 
> $ cat -A File &#8212; Show the Non-Printable Chars also
> 
> $ cat > File &#8212; Concat the STDIN to STDOUT & FILE. This can be used to quickly create a file with some content. After you have finished typing the contents, press Ctrl+D to save.
