<img align="right" id="image328" alt="Liferea" src="/uploads/2006/12/liferea-48.png" />Today I was analyzing my RSS Feeds and saw that there are about 59 subscribers(thanks to [Ubuntu Blog][1]) and saw that there was a Reader called [Liferea][2]. I have heard of this before, but didnt give a try. So I thought &#8211; why don&#8217;t I install it and see how it works out. So I just went to Synaptic and did a quick search for Liferea and installed it.

It is cool and works great. It is actually developed for Linux users who want a good Feed Reader. You have easily customizable panes with 2 or 3 pane mode. Also you can set how many items to save under each feed. Overall: a nice and fast reader to try if you are under linux.
