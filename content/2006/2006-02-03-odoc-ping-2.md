ping &#8212; send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

Summary :

This is one of the most important command every system administrator must know to handle a network. Packet InterNet Groper uses the ICMP protocol&#8217;s mandatory ECHO\_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO\_RESPONSE from a host or gateway to find whether it is alive or not. See [http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html][1].
