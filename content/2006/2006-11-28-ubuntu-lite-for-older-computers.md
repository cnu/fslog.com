<img align="left" alt="Ubuntu Lite" id="image293" src="http://www.fslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/ubuntulite.png" />Ubuntu Lite is a stripped down version of the popular Ubuntu GNU/Linux system. This is can bring the life to those old hardware lying around. You can check it out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ubuntulite.org/drupal/?q=node/1">here</a>, and download a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wolfteck.com/files/UbuntuLite-1.1.iso.torrent">torrent for an install CD here</a>.

The default Window Manager is IceWM. It has Abiword and GNUMeric for the basic office needs. I think I would like to see it running on the old system that I have just to see it working.
