sum &#8212; Compute and Check .

Summary:

**sum** computes a 16-Bit checksum for each given file(s)/stdin. By default, it computes checksums using an algorithm compatible with BSD sum and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

Example:

> $ sum file &#8212; Print checksum and block counts.
> 
> $ sum file1 file2 &#8212; Print checksum, block counts and filename.
> 
> $ sum -r file &#8212; Default. Use BSD sum algorithm (1KB/Block).
> 
> $ sum -s file &#8212; Use System V sum algorithm (512 bytes/Block).
