Here is a survival guide for the famous editors of all time &#8211; vi. This [vi survival guide][1] was written in vi and is a nice tutorial to know how to get yourself familiar with the keystrokes required in vi. However I use [emacs][2] &#8211; which I think is more easier to use than vi or nano.
