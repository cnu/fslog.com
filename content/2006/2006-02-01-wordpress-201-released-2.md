WordPress 2.0 made big waves at the blogging world, and soon everyone upgraded to the new wordpress blog engine. But, there were some bugs and sometimes I felt that the older 1.5 version was better. But, the import tool for Blogger was really nice and I love it. Exactly 1 month after version 2.0 was released, the [2.01 version has been released][1]. The wordpress development team has squashed out [114 bugs][2]. To summarize:

  * You can now specify an upload directory, and whether to use date-based storage or not.
  * Caching has been fixed under certain PHP enviroments.
  * Permalinks have been fixed for weird enviroments as well.
  * XML-RPC uploading works.
  * Compatibility with older versions of PHP.
  * Several WYSIWYG fixes and cleanups.
  * Imports now use much less memory.
  * Now works with MySQL 5.0 in strict mode.

Some users complain that wordpress doesn&#8217;t provide the support found in other proprietary blogging softwares(like [Movabletype][3]). In my opinion, the users in the IRC channel of wordpress(#wordpress) are very helpful and I was able to [correct a small problem][4] within minutes. What is your opinion on this and have you experienced any problem with any of the blogging softwares?
