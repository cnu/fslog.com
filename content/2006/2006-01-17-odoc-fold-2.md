fold &#8212; Wrap each input line to fit in specified width.

Summary :

**fold** wrap input lines in each input file and writes the output to standard output. \`fold&#8217; counts screen columns by default.

Examples :

> $ fold myfile &#8212; Fold each input line at column 80 and print in the screen/stdout.
> 
> $ fold -w 40 myfile > myfile1 &#8212; Fold each input line at column 40 and the output is redirected to myfile1.
> 
> $ fold -s -w40 f1 f2 &#8212; Fold each input line of f1 and f2 at column 40 and folding will happen at space only.
> 
> $ fold -b 40 myfile &#8212; Folds at 40th byte place.
> 
> $ fold -c 40 myfile &#8212; Folds at 40th character position.

Note:

  * Normally all the above options will give same output. Difference can be felt only with multi-byte encodings, like UTF-8&#8230;
  * A tab may count more than one column, backspace decreases the column count, and carriage return sets the column to zero.
