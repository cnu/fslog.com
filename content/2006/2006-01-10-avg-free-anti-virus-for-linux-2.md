[Grisoft][1], the makers of award-winning product <tag>AVG</tag> Free <tag>Antivirus</tag> has released it for <tag>GNU/Linux</tag>. I used to use AVG antivirus for windows and found it to be effective against numerous <tag>viruses</tag>. It was also providing maximum protection with little resources.

AVG for linux has the following features:

  * Rapid virus database updates for the lifetime of the product

  * Automatic update functionality
