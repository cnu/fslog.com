[IT@School][1] GNU/Linux is a [single CD][2] customised GNU/Linux distribution containing the typical software tools required by an high school student or teacher. Apart from a host of typical desktop applications it also contains various educational applications like TuxPaint, Ghemical, Kalzium, DrGeo, Gcompris etc.

The CD was developed by IT@School Project in association with Free Software Foundation of India (www.gnu.org.in).

It has various tools like Editors, Educational Tools, Internet Browsing tools, Python for teaching programming, etc. It would be nice OS for a student. However I wonder, how many school children get to work with a computer in the remote villages in India?
