Jon from [New Linux User][1] has started a new <tag>blog</tag> series called [One Day One Site][2]. He would be writing about the various sites/forums where one frequents if they face some problem while on their <tag>GNU/Linux</tag> box. So, he is going to visit such sites and forums and make a small review of that site. It sure helps to get to know more sites other than to just depend on out <tag>LUG</tag>&#8216;s mailing list.
