<img align="right" alt="Globulation 2" id="image329" src="/uploads/2006/12/globulation_2.png" />[Globulation 2][1] is an innovative Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game which reduces micro-management by automatically assigning tasks to units. This means the user just has to assign specific number of units for a task and the units automatically do what is best for that job.

  * It has nice AIs with varying levels of difficulties
  * Includes a scripting language for versatile gameplay
  * Nice set of tutorials which walk through the player with the various tasks
  * An integrated map editor allowing you to create your own maps
  * Play in single player, local area network or over the internet with [Ysagoon Online Gaming][2].

One unique thing about this game is that it doesn&#8217;t have any humans or other creatures. All the characters in this game are called globs(see pic) and look and move funny. It is a nice game and I am playing it for the past 2 days.

It is available in Synaptic, but it would be better if you could [download and install][3] it.
