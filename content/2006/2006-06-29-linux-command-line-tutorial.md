Here is a comprehensive tutorial which teaches the new linux user &#8211; who has always used GUI tools to do his stuff. It starts with a nice example which can make a complex C++ program to find out how much space each user uses into a simple one line bash command. Just go and learn [shell programming][1] which can really improve productivity.
