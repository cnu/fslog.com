mount &#8212; Mount/Attach a File System to a File Tree.

Summary :

All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some device to the big file tree.

> 
> $ mount -l &#8212; List all mounted FSs with Labels.

> \# mount -a &#8212; Mount all entries in the /etc/fstab.
> 
> \# mount /mnt/cdrom &#8212; Mount known device to cdrom dir. Mount will find the cdrom device (/dev/hdX) from /etc/fstab.
> 
> \# mount /dev/hdd &#8212; Mount device at the known place. Mount will find the mount point (Ex. /mnt/cdrom) from /etc/fstab.

> 
> \# mount -t vfat -o rw,umask=0007 /dev/hda1 /mnt/C &#8212; Mount Windows FAT partition
