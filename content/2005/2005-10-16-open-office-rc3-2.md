[OpenOffice.org][1] made available for free download a third release candidate of Version 2.0 of its popular open-source office suite Friday. The release includes bug fixes only and no new features.

The project had planned to release its final 2.0 version on Oct. 13—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the organization—but it decided to hold off due to a &#8220;show-stopping&#8221; problem with the software. No new date has been attached to the final release, but community manager Louis Suarez-Potts said it could be ready as early as next week or as late as the end of the month.
