Some days ago, I wanted to try Ubuntu for PowerPC in our iMac labs and so I popped the CD and rebooted. But, I didn&#8217;t know how to make the system boot through the CD. After some searching, I found out a way to boot through the CD.

Hold down the **c key** when booting the computer or **Command-Option-Shift-Delete** key combo. You will get a menu where you can choose from which media boot the computer. It is just so easy to do. Have anyone installed Ubuntu on their apples? Tell me about your experiences.
