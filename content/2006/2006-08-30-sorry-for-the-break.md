Actually I am sorry for the long break in my blogging. I was too much occupied in the college work and I have to do my final year project next semester and I plan to learn Ruby on Rails atleast for this project. I have to spend more time for Ruby. Anyway, let me see if I can write some sort of series for learning Ruby or RoR. I will have to do that after I have learnt something.

By the way, I have also changed the theme to a better looking (atleast thats what i think) one than the default Kubrick theme. Though I am not a huge fan of such kind of design (i prefer 2 column) I will see how good this one works out.

Update: I have changed to a better looking theme. I dont like that old theme. Anyway I will stick with this for now. Maybe change it later.
