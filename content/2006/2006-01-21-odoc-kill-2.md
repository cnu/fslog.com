kill &#8212; Sends a signal to processes.

Summary :
  
The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified process or process group. If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent. Signals are used for Inter Process Communications(IPC).
  
Examples :

> $ kill -l &#8212; Print a list of signal names with numbers.
  
> $ kill -l SIGIO &#8212; Print the number for SIGIO signal.
  
> $ kill -l 9 &#8212; Print the Name for the Signal number 9.
  
> $ kill 100 200 &#8212; Send TERM signal to processes with PID 100 and 200.
  
> $ kill -s 9 100 &#8212; Send KILL signal to process with PID 100.
  
> $ kill -n SIGKILL 100 &#8212; Same as above
  
> $ kill -SIGKILL 100 &#8212; Same as above.
  
> $ kill -9 100 &#8212; Same as above.
  
> $ kill -9 -1 &#8212; Kill all your login sessions. But Not the current one.

NOTE:

  * Two kill commands are available. One is built-in SHELL (default) and 2nd is in /usr/bin/kill.
  * We can use either Signal Name or Number.
