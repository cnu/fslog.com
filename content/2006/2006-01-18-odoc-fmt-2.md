Summary :

**fmt** reads from the specified file arguments or stdin, and writes to stdout.

Examples :

> $ fmt myfile &#8212; Format myfile and max line length is 75.

> $ fmt f1 f2 &#8212; Format f1 f2 and max line length is 75.

> $ fmt -w 60 f1 f2 &#8212; Same as above but max line length is 60.

> $ fmt -s myfile &#8212; Don&#8217;t split the small line. Useful if your file contains some sample program codes.

> $ fmt -u myfile &#8212; Uniform spacing. One space between words. Two space between sentences.

> $ fmt -p BB myfile &#8212; Only lines beginning with BB will be formatted.

> $ fmt -t myfile &#8212; Paragraph indentation will be preserved.

Note: By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation are preserved in the output; successive input lines with different indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on output.
