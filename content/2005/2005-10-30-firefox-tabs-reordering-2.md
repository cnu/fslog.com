I noticed a really cool feature in Firefox 1.5 beta2.
  
You can drag the tab and reorder the tab anywhere you want it to be. This is a really cool feature I wanted for many days. I always like my tabs to be present in a particular order. I guess this feature was available from Firefox 1.1 DeerPark.
