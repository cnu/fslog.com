The Linux users group (LUG) of Bellevue, Washington, recently published an article titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/reasons_to_convert.html">&#8220;25 Reasons to Convert to Linux&#8221;</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/">group&#8217;s Web site</a>. The comprehensive list discusses the well-known reasons why &#8220;Businesses, educational institutions, governmental agencies and other organizations around the world are converting their computer operating systems from Microsoft Windows to Linux at an increasing pace&#8221;&#8211;cost, licensing issues, support from the community and security.
